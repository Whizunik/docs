# WH-TECH-01 — Whizunik Hub Product & Module Register

**Version:** 1.0
**Type:** Day 1 — Existing Product Inventory & Module Register (evidence-based)
**Source:** Deep-dive inspection of the repository (frontend, backend, database layer, configuration, deployment, documentation)
**Date:** 2026-08-17
**Status:** Draft for Sankalp review

---

## 1. Document Purpose

This register documents the **current, actually-implemented** Whizunik Hub product and classifies every verified module/feature for standardisation and reusability. It is an inventory exercise only:

- No new functionality was developed.
- No code was refactored or modified.
- No architectural decisions were made.
- Nothing is documented as implemented unless it could be verified from source code, UI routes, API routes, database models, configuration, deployment files, or documentation.
- Items that could not be verified are explicitly marked **Unknown / Partially Verified / Needs Review**.

Day 2 activities (architecture documentation, technical debt analysis, security assessment, Intelligence Engine architecture) are **out of scope** for this document.

---

## 2. Product Overview (verified functionality only)

Whizunik Hub is a web platform with two distinct business workflows implemented in one codebase:

1. **Receivables factoring & monitoring** (the platform's original positioning — the public landing page is titled *"Whizunik — Receivables factoring & monitoring"*): invoice submission, checker approval, treasury funding queue, advances against receivables, debtor master, invoice reminders, Notice of Assignment (NOA) emails, ageing/portfolio dashboards.
2. **Goods trading lifecycle** (built out most recently, branded internally as the *"Adventra Goods Platform"*): product catalogue, quotations, sales orders, purchase orders, goods receipts (GRN), dispatch notes, inventory stock movements, and a demand-forecasting + pricing-recommendation engine.

Both workflows share one platform: a React 19 SPA (TanStack Router/Query, Tailwind v4, shadcn/Radix UI, Recharts) calling an Express 4 + TypeScript API, backed by a **single-table DynamoDB design** (GSI1 client-scoped, GSI2 entity-scoped) with S3 for file storage and Nodemailer for transactional email. Auth is JWT in an httpOnly SameSite=Strict cookie with role-based access control (7 roles).

**Naming discrepancy (recorded, not resolved):** the product appears under three names — **Whizunik** (public brand + theme key `whizunik-theme`), **Insight Factor** (server logs, email templates, admin account, repo/package name, DynamoDB table default `InsightFactor`), and **Adventra** (deployment domain `adventra.whizunikhub.com`, NOA email branding, seed data, documentation and PPT decks). See §8 and §10.

## 3. Product Module Register

Legend — Status: **Live** / **Testing** / **Development** / **Needs Review** (exactly one; runtime status cannot be verified from the repo, so most rows are "Needs Review" with the deployment evidence noted). Classification: **CORE** / **CONFIGURABLE** / **OPTIONAL MODULE** / **CLIENT-SPECIFIC** / **Needs Sankalp Review** (with rationale).

- Backend field-transform middleware: request snake_case→camelCase, response camelCase→snake_case (`middleware/transform.ts`) — every frontend type uses snake_case.

## 5. Client-Specific Functionality

**Globalor — not found.** A repository-wide search for "Globalor" (case-insensitive) returned **zero matches**. No Globalor module, workflow, terminology, dashboard, report, rule or integration exists in this repository. Either Globalor lives in a different repository, was never merged, or the reference is mistaken — **requires Sankalp confirmation** (§8 Q1).

**Retail — no client-specific implementation found.** "Retail" appears only in (a) the MRP field description ("max retail price") and (b) demo/seed company names (e.g. "MetroMart Retail Pvt Ltd", "Khan Retailers", "Menon Retail Group" in `scripts/seed-crm-demo.ts`) and slide decks. No retail-specific business logic exists.

| # | Client | Functionality | Why client-specific | Reusable? | Evidence | Sankalp recommendation |
|---|--------|---------------|---------------------|-----------|----------|------------------------|
| C1 | Adventra | NOA email branding hard-coded to `"Adventra"` in the send-NOA route, while every other email/PDF resolves the company name from the user record | Hard-coded constant in business logic (`const companyName = "Adventra";` in `routes/index.ts`) | Yes — move to the per-client invoice template / user profile (module 26 is already the natural home) | `backend/src/routes/index.ts` (send-noa) | Confirm Adventra is a client brand; approve moving branding into the configurable template |
| C2 | Adventra | Demo/seed datasets branded with Adventra SKUs (`ADV-RC-001` "Adventra Trail Rain Cover", etc.) and Whizunik demo accounts | Scripts `seed-sku-movements.ts`, `seed-forecast-demo.ts`, `seed-crm-demo.ts` are Adventra-specific; scripts write to the **real DynamoDB table** per their headers | Partially — the scripts are generic scaffolding, the data is not | `backend/scripts/*.ts` | Confirm whether demo data has leaked into production data; decide whether to keep/remove seed scripts |
| C3 | Adventra | Deployment/branding: `adventra.whizunikhub.com` in nginx config, PM2 app name `adventra-backend`, `CORS_ORIGIN`, `DEPLOY.md`, PPT decks | Infrastructure + docs targeted at one tenant domain | Yes — parametrise domain/branding for multi-tenant deployment | `deploy/nginx.conf`, `ecosystem.config.cjs`, `backend/.env.example`, `DEPLOY.md`, `ppt-generator/` | Confirm production topology (single-tenant vs multi-tenant); see §8 Q4 |
| C4 | (n/a) | **No Globalor references exist** — see note above | — | — | repo-wide search | Clarify with Sankalp |

**No whole module was classified CLIENT-SPECIFIC** — the Adventra-specific code is confined to branding constants, seed data, and deployment config. All goods/inventory modules are generic (client-scoped via `clientId`) and classified OPTIONAL MODULE pending Sankalp's product decision.

## 6. Reusability Opportunities

| Opportunity | Today | Could become | Evidence | Effort estimate (qualitative) |
|-------------|-------|--------------|----------|-------------------------------|
| Invoice/document branding (colors, logo, tax id, terms, bank details) | Per-client `InvoiceTemplate` used by browser print only | **CONFIGURABLE core** — also feed the emailed PDFs (document-pdf + NOA) so server emails match the client template | `app.template.tsx`, `components/invoice-print.tsx`, `lib/document-pdf.ts`, `routes/index.ts` (NOA hard-codes Adventra) | Low — one shared data source, two consumers |
| Reminder thresholds `[15,7,2,1,0]` | Hard-coded | **CONFIGURABLE** — per-client reminder cadence | `invoice-reminder.ts` | Low |
| Default advance rate (0.80) & fee rate (0.025) | Model defaults | **CONFIGURABLE** — per-client defaults | `models/invoice.ts`, `models/purchase-invoice.ts` | Low |
| Currency | Fields exist (CoA, proforma) but emails/PDFs hard-code USD/$ | **CONFIGURABLE** — honour the stored currency everywhere | `email.ts`, `lib/document-pdf.ts`, `models/*.ts` | Medium (touch all money formatting) |
| Alert generation | Manual admin trigger only | **CORE automated** — scheduled overdue/risk alert generation | `routes/index.ts` (alerts), `invoice-reminder.ts` (scheduler pattern to reuse) | Low–Medium |
| Goods lifecycle (catalogue → PO → GRN, quotation → SO → dispatch → invoice) | Implemented, Adventra-driven | **Optional reusable module** for any distribution/retail customer | `models/goods-*.ts`, `COMPLETE-WORKFLOW-GUIDE.md` | Already built — packaging/documentation effort |
| Forecasting + pricing engine | Implemented; duplicated FE/BE copies | **Core differentiator / optional module** — decision needed (see §8 Q6) | `lib/forecast-engine.ts` (×2), `services/forecast-service.ts` | Already built |
| CRM, Submissions/Workspace, View-As, NOA, Approvals | Implemented, partly demo-seeded | **Optional modules** with per-client enablement (feature flags don't exist yet) | see §3 modules 28–33 | Packaging/config effort |
| `Vendor` (legacy) + `Supplier` masters | Two models merged in UI | **Single Supplier master**, migrate Vendor data | `models/vendor.ts`, `models/supplier.ts`, `routes/index.ts` | Medium (data migration) — refactor, out of Day 1 scope |

---

## 7. Duplicated Functionality

Recorded for awareness only — **not fixed**.

| # | Duplicated functionality | Locations | Apparent reason | Possible common capability | Needs review? |
|---|--------------------------|-----------|-----------------|----------------------------|---------------|
| D1 | **Forecast engine kept in two identical copies** (explicit "KEEP IN SYNC" comment) | `backend/src/lib/forecast-engine.ts` vs `frontend/src/lib/forecast-engine.ts` | Server computes/persists; client renders live — same logic shipped twice | Single shared package/module | Yes — risk of drift; sync comment already warns |
| D2 | **Two supplier-side masters**: `Supplier` (new, global) and `Vendor` (legacy, client-scoped) | `models/supplier.ts`, `models/vendor.ts`; merged in every procurement dropdown; purchase invoices/POs can reference either | Migration from legacy Vendor to Supplier model | Single supplier master | Yes |
| D3 | **Two "purchase order" concepts**: `PurchaseOrder` (proforma/funding) vs `GoodsPurchaseOrder` (catalogue PO) | `models/purchase-order.ts`, `models/goods-purchase-order.ts` | Deliberate split (funding vs goods) but names collide | Clearer naming/namespacing | Yes — naming review |
| D4 | **Balance sheet implemented twice**: as a tab in `/app/accounting` and as a standalone `/app/balance-sheet` route (both fetch CoA+invoices+PIs+advances+stock+journals+expenses) | `frontend/src/routes/app.accounting.tsx`, `frontend/src/routes/app.balance-sheet.tsx` | Two-page build-out of the same report | One report component | Yes |
| D5 | **Parallel aggregation paths**: `/dashboard` API, `/user-progress` API, dashboard page KPIs, reporting page, and balance-sheet all recompute totals independently | `routes/index.ts` (dashboard, user-progress), `app.dashboard.tsx`, `app.reporting.tsx`, `app.balance-sheet.tsx` | No shared analytics/query layer | Shared metrics service | Yes — metric drift risk |
| D6 | **Two invoice line/amount structures** on the Invoice model: legacy `lineItems`/`subtotal`/`taxRate`/`taxAmount` alongside new `lines`/`subtotalGoods`/`gstTotal`/`grandTotal` | `models/invoice.ts` | Migration in progress; emails still read legacy fields | Single canonical line/totals shape | Yes |
| D7 | **Two PDF/print pipelines**: backend `document-pdf.ts` (emailed PDFs) vs frontend `invoice-print.tsx` PrintShell (browser print) | `backend/src/lib/document-pdf.ts`, `frontend/src/components/invoice-print.tsx` | Different contexts (attachment vs print) | Shared document renderer (or server-rendered HTML→PDF) | Yes |
| D8 | **Reminder triggers in multiple places**: hourly scheduler + instant triggers inside invoice/purchase-invoice create/update handlers | `invoice-reminder.ts` + `routes/index.ts` (several `sendReminderForInvoice` call sites) | Responsiveness (instant) + batch (scheduler) | Single reminder dispatch service with dedupe | Low risk; verify dedupe holds |
| D9 | **Stock balance / inventory value computed several ways**: dashboard sums only `direction==="in"` (no debits), balance sheet and forecast compute confirmed in−out | `routes/index.ts` (dashboard), `app.dashboard.tsx`, `app.balance-sheet.tsx`, `forecast-service.ts` | Different definitions per consumer | Single stock-valuation helper | Yes — numbers can disagree |

## 8. Items Requiring Sankalp Review

1. **Q1 — "Globalor":** no reference exists anywhere in the repository. Is Globalor a separate codebase, a planned client, or an error in the brief?
2. **Q2 — Product naming:** the platform is simultaneously "Whizunik" (public brand), "Insight Factor" (legacy product/API/admin/DynamoDB default), and "Adventra" (deployment domain + NOA branding + docs). Which is the official product name for the register and future branding?
3. **Q3 — Adventra status:** is Adventra a live production tenant, a demo, or the seed client? Should the register treat the goods lifecycle as "built for Adventra" or "built for Whizunik Hub generally"?
4. **Q4 — Deployment topology:** production config targets a single domain (`adventra.whizunikhub.com`) with a single DynamoDB table and per-user `clientId` scoping. Is the intended model **single-tenant per install**, **multi-tenant shared**, or **per-client forks**? This determines how much of the CLIENT-SPECIFIC items become CONFIGURABLE.
5. **Q5 — Status (Live/Testing/Development):** deployment artifacts exist (PM2, nginx, Let's Encrypt paths) but runtime status cannot be verified from the repo. Sankalp must confirm which modules are live in production, in testing, or in development.
6. **Q6 — Forecasting & pricing engine:** is this the flagship **CORE** differentiator (marketing, PPTs and formula docs suggest yes) or an **OPTIONAL MODULE** for goods clients? Classification affects everything downstream.
7. **Q7 — Alerts automation:** alert *generation* is only manual (admin button). Is automated alert generation (like the reminder scheduler) planned/required?
8. **Q8 — Accounting integration depth:** the accounting page claims "every financial movement becomes a balanced journal," but journals are currently **manual only** — invoices, payments, GRNs and dispatches do not auto-post entries. Is this the intended state (manual bookkeeping) or a gap?
9. **Q9 — Currency/region:** GSTIN/HSN fields (India) coexist with default currency USD and `$` formatting in emails/PDFs. What are the target currencies/regions for the common product?
10. **Q10 — Debtor scoping:** Debtors are global (no `clientId`) while Products, Vendors, Invoices, etc. are client-scoped. Intentional (shared debtor book across clients) or an inconsistency?
11. **Q11 — Vendor vs Supplier:** legacy `Vendor` + new `Supplier` — is consolidation planned?
12. **Q12 — CRM and Submissions demo data:** only seeded demo data exists (including `sankalp@whizunik.com` and `ram@gmail.com` accounts writing to the real table). Are these features production-active, and should seed scripts be removed/guarded?
13. **Q13 — Duplication:** are D1–D9 (incl. the dual balance-sheet routes and dual invoice-line structures) intentional migration states or debt to schedule?
14. **Q14 — Naming collision:** `PurchaseOrder` (proforma) vs `GoodsPurchaseOrder` — confirm the product terminology going forward.
15. **Q15 — Planned vs implemented:** several prompt-listed concepts (Intelligence Engine, pricing *recommendations* applied automatically, Globalor) are **not implemented** — confirm none are expected to be documented as present.
16. **Q16 — Multi-client dashboards:** `scope=all` lists expose all clients' invoices/PIs/expenses to the shared dashboard. Is cross-client visibility intended for all roles, or should it be restricted?

## 10. Limitations / Unknowns

1. **Runtime status unverifiable:** nothing in the repo proves which environment is live. Status is "Needs Review" everywhere; deployment artifacts (PM2, nginx, env examples) are the only evidence.
2. **Globalor:** zero references; treated as **not present** in this repository (see §5).
3. **Database contents:** DynamoDB is single-table with no schema/migration files; the register documents the *models'* shape, not the actual data. Seed scripts suggest real-table demo data exists but that cannot be confirmed from code.
4. **Intelligence Engine:** the prompt mentions a future Intelligence Engine — **not implemented**; the closest verified capability is the deterministic forecast/pricing engine (module 31).
5. **Secrets:** env values and credentials were not read/exported; only `.env.example` keys and config shapes are referenced.
6. **Frontend UI verification:** routes/pages were inventoried from source; no browser walkthrough was performed.
7. **Feature counts are approximate:** features were tallied from the deep-dive; a few lists may be ±5.
8. **Reports nuance:** `/app/reporting` (sales/purchase/ageing report cards) and `/app/reports` (reporting-manager team view) are distinct pages; their product relationship is unclear (see §8).
9. **Route orphans:** `/app/vendors` and `/app/accounting` exist as routes but do not appear in the admin sidebar (suppliers + balance-sheet are surfaced instead) — legacy entry points retained.

---

## 11. Executive Summary

1. **Total modules discovered:** 34 (18 Core, 2 Configurable, 14 Optional).
2. **Total major features discovered:** ≈260 verified in code.
3. **Core count:** 18 modules (auth/RBAC, dashboard, masters, invoices AR/AP, expenses, advances, alerts, audit, reminders, CoA, journals, credit/debit notes, balance sheet, file storage, public pages).
4. **Configurable count:** 2 modules (catalogue settings, invoice/document templates) — with 4 more strong candidates listed in §6.
5. **Optional Module count:** 14 (goods catalogue/inventory/PO/GRN/quotation/SO/dispatch, proformas/funding, CRM, submissions, view-as, forecasting, NOA, approvals).
6. **Client-Specific count:** 0 modules; 3 items (Adventra NOA branding hard-coded in a route, Adventra seed/demo data, Adventra deployment config). **Globalor does not exist in this repository.**
7. **Items requiring Sankalp review:** 16 questions (§8).
8. **Major reusable opportunities:** per-client document branding for all outputs (incl. emailed PDFs), configurable reminder thresholds/advance rates, automated alert generation, the already-built goods lifecycle as a reusable optional module, and the forecast/pricing engine as a potential core differentiator.
9. **Major client-specific functionality:** hard-coded "Adventra" NOA branding (C1); Adventra-branded demo seeds writing to the real table (C2); adventra.whizunikhub.com deployment (C3).
10. **Major uncertainties:** product naming (Whizunik vs Insight Factor vs Adventra); production status; single- vs multi-tenant; Globalor's absence; whether forecasting is core or optional; accounting depth (manual journals only); currency/region; debtor scoping; alert automation.

## 12. Recommended Discussion Agenda With Sankalp

1. **Naming & identity** (Q2, Q3): Whizunik Hub vs Insight Factor vs Adventra — official name, and whether Adventra is a client or the seed tenant.
2. **Globalor** (Q1): confirm it lives elsewhere or does not exist.
3. **Production status** (Q5): which modules are Live/Testing/Development today.
4. **Deployment topology** (Q4, Q16): single-tenant vs multi-tenant; whether `scope=all` cross-client dashboards are intended.
5. **Forecast/pricing engine positioning** (Q6): Core differentiator vs optional module.
6. **Branding/configurability approvals** (C1, §6): move NOA branding to the template; approve configurable reminder cadence, advance/fee defaults, currency handling.
7. **Data hygiene** (Q12, C2): demo seed data in the real table — cleanup decision.
8. **Duplication triage** (D1–D9, Q11, Q13, Q14): confirm which duplicates are intentional migration states vs debt (no fixes in Day 1).
9. **Accounting depth** (Q8, Q9): manual-journals-only vs auto-posting; target currency/region.
10. **Alert automation** (Q7) and **debtor scoping** (Q10).
